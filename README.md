The TSUM analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of patients diagnosed with autoimmune diseases using three interconnected datasets: 
The TSUM analysis comprehensively evaluates patients diagnosed with autoimmune diseases using three interconnected datasets: TSUM_A, TSUM_B, and TSUM_C. These datasets encompass many data points, including patient demographics, clinical diagnoses, laboratory test results, and detailed examination records. The primary focus of this analysis is to unearth patterns, correlations, and potential anomalies among patients suffering from autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and others.

Key aspects of the TSUM analysis include:

Demographic and Clinical Data (TSUM_A): This dataset provides foundational patient information, including age, sex, and specific diagnoses. This data forms the base for understanding the distribution and prevalence of various autoimmune diseases across different demographic segments.

Laboratory and Examination Data (TSUM_B): Critical for understanding the clinical nuances of each case, this dataset includes results from tests like ANA, aCL (IgG, IgM, IgA), KCT, RVVT, and LAC. It also contains details about the examination dates and additional diagnoses, which are pivotal in tracking disease progression and response to treatment.

Supplementary Medical Data (TSUM_C): Although the specifics of this dataset are not detailed, it likely includes additional relevant medical information that complements the other two datasets, providing a more holistic view of each patient's health status.

The analysis employs statistical methods to analyze these datasets collectively, aiming to:

Identify trends in the incidence and distribution of autoimmune diseases.
Explore correlations between various laboratory markers and clinical diagnoses.
Detect anomalies or unusual patterns that might suggest unique disease subtypes or patient groups.
This investigation is crucial for enhancing the understanding of autoimmune diseases, potentially leading to more effective treatment strategies, better patient management, and insights into the underlying causes of these complex conditions.
